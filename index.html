    <h1>Hello Nerds</h1>
    <p class="welcome">Welcome to the middle of nowhere. If you thought I was selling deer beef here, know that I have never come in possession of one.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 25px; color: chocolate;">This website is dedicated to literally nothing. Have a great day.</p>
